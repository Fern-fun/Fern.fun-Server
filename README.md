## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Our RaspberryPI takes care of collecting various data connected to: current versions of a range of different apps, current currency data and usage data about itself, e.g. RAM usage, CPU temperature and usage. Now we mostly use it as a tool to test a spectrum of different libraries, tools and apps.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>
